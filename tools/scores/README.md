# Score builder

Renders the per-loop SVG scores in `scores/` from LilyPond sources in this directory.

## Sources
- `allemande.ly` — Bach Cello Suite No. 1, Allemande (BWV 1007). Forked from
  the community LilyPond typeset at
  [babysnakes/Bach---Cello-Suites](https://github.com/babysnakes/Bach---Cello-Suites)
  (Bärenreiter-based), with editorial slurs, bow markings and trills added
  by hand to follow the Peters/Becker edition.

## Build
Requires LilyPond on `$PATH`. Run `tools/scores/setup.sh` to install it if
missing (`apt-get install lilypond`); in Claude Code on the web this runs
automatically via the `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/`, so a fresh session is
ready to rebuild scores without manual setup.

From the repo root:

```
python3 tools/scores/build_scores.py
```

The script reads each loop in `songs.json`, parses the measure range out of
its `label` (e.g. `"mm 4-6"`), extracts those measures from the matching
LilyPond source, and writes the cropped SVG to the path in the loop's
`score` field.

For ranges that don't start at m. 1, the earlier measures are emitted inside
`\set Score.skipTypesetting = ##t` so LilyPond parses them silently —
necessary because the source uses `\relative` notation and slicing measures
out of context shifts later pitches by an octave or more.

### One measure per line (important)
The splitter treats **each line of the music as one measure**. Keep one measure
per line, and keep any `\set` / `\once` / `\override` on the **same line** as the
measure it applies to (e.g. `\once \set fingeringOrientations = #'(down) <…>4 …`).
A setting on its own line counts as an extra "measure" and shifts every later
index, corrupting all the SVGs. After a build, `git status` should show only the
SVG(s) you meant to change — if others changed, a measure boundary shifted.

## Adding notes or notations
See the `score-workflow` skill (`.claude/skills/score-workflow/`) for the full
process: transcribing notes from IMSLP, then adding fingerings/articulations/
dynamics a few measures at a time from edition screen captures, and rebuilding.
